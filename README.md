# SEI50 Phaser Demo

Hi all!

This repo contains the set up for a demo of a game framework called [Phaser](https://phaser.io/).

**Update**: This now contains where we got to during our session :) if you want to finish off the game, you can follow the rest of the tutorial from the website (we only had [one step to go](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part10)!)

## Getting started

If you want to follow along with this tutorial, you'll need a clone of this repository as well as a local web server.

It's best to use either [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or the built-in python server (you shouldn't need any set up for this one â€“ just run `python -m SimpleHttpServer` in your terminal).
